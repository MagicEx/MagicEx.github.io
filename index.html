    <h2><strong>Welcome</strong></h2>
     <!--   <p>This website's only purpose is to show how I progress as a web developer. My goal is to have developed a website with decent frontend
          
        and backend properties before summer lets out.  This project will hopefully keep me motivated towards that goal. This website will make
          
        no sense what soever but that is ok because I am just trying to develop a skill.</p> -->
       <p>This website is were my brain goes to throw up.  I started this project as a means to learn html, css, and maybe some javascript but now it is just a barf bucket.  If I have something that I need to watch and I don't have a place for it to go, <strong>BOOM</strong>... I put a link to it. This desolate place on the interwebs is just something I used to keep me busy (I still do use it like that) but now it has become a horrid "landfill" that I use as a journal so to speek.  If you happen to stumble upon this, just move along.</p>
