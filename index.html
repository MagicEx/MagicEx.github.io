    <h1><strong>Welcome</strong></h1>
      <p>This website's only purpose is to show how I progress as a web developer. I started learning HTML on 5-24-19 at around 1:30, went to bed and then continued back once I was refreshed. My goal is to have developed a website with decent frontend and backend properties before summer lets out.  This project will hopefully keep me motivated towards that goal. This site may have some unique characteristics that make no sence what so ever but that doesn't really matter.  I am just trying to develop a skill.</p>

     <p>I am learning how to add pictures and videos to a website currently so I figured I should add some to my website.</p>
    
     <img src="Joseph%20Stalin.jpg" alt="A glorius picture of Joseph Stalin" />
     <p>That is a picture of Joseph Stalin becuase of reasons</p>
     
     <p>This is one of my favorite sounds</p>

        <p>Here are some misiclanious (pardon the spelling) things that I learned such as making things <strong>Bold</strong> or making it <em>italics</em>.
        Also here are some list:
            <ol>
              <li>One fish</li>
              <li>Two fish</li>
            </ol>
            <ul>
                <li>Red fish</li>
                <li>Blue fish</li>
            </ul>
