    <h1><strong>Welcome</strong></h1>
      <p>This website's only purpose is to show how I progress as a web developer. My goal is to have developed a website with decent frontend 
        and backend properties before summer lets out.  This project will hopefully keep me motivated towards that goal. This website will make
        no sense what soever but that is ok because I am just trying to develop a skill.</p>
